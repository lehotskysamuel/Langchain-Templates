# Langchain Templates

Nothing new here, I just wanted to peek under the hood of Langchain templates, so I've added
all that I'm interested in here with `pipx run langchain-cli app add $TEMPLATE_NAME`.

See all those templates inside packages folder.

Find the list of the templates [online here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/templates)
